JourneyCusine üéì

üåê Explore, Book, Enjoy ‚Äì Your Ultimate Hotel & Property Booking Solution

This is the GitHub repository for JourneyCusine, a full-stack hotel and property booking application built using the MERN stack. The project allows users to discover, book, and host properties seamlessly. Inspired by Airbnb‚Äôs design, this app goes beyond standard hotel booking by enabling users to host their own hotels or houses.

I designed and developed this project end-to-end, focusing on intuitive user interaction and a smooth experience for both booking and hosting.
